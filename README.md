# Problem Statement
Retail Sales Prediction is a regression machine learning project. Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

Businesses use sales forecasts to determine what revenue they will be generating in a particular timespan to empower themselves with powerful and strategic business plans. Important decisions such as budgets, hiring, incentives, goals, acquisitions and various other growth plans are affected by the revenue the company is going to make in the coming months and for these plans to be as effective as they are planned to be it is important for these forecasts to also be as good.

The work here forecasts the sales of the various Rossmann stores across Europe for the recent six weeks and compares the results from the models developed with the actual sales values
